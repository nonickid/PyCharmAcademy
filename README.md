#### [Duplicate File Handler Project](Duplicate_File_Handler/duplicate_file_handler.py)

Project description:
>Duplicate File Handler is a useful tool that can free some space on your drive. Write a handler that checks and compares files in a folder, displays the result, and removes duplicates.

#### [Bill Splitter](Bill_Splitter/bill_splitter.py)

Project description:
> Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.


#### [Coffee Machine](Coffee_Machine/coffee_machine.py)

Project description:
> What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.


#### [Honest Calculator](Honest_Calculator/honest_calculator.py)

Project description:
> The International Union Against Idleness (IUAI) announced a competition for an application that would motivate users. There are prizes involved. Since you like competing and know a little bit about programming, you asked your friend to prepare an interesting algorithm for a quick buck. Unfortunately, you weren't clear enough, and instead of a ready-made program, a friend prepared a flowchart of Honest Calculator. You will have to put some effort into assembling it.
